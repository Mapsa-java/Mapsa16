Entity lifecycle refers to the various states an entity goes through during its existence within an
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework like Hibernate.
Understanding the entity lifecycle is crucial for working effectively 
with Hibernate and managing entity persistence.

The entity lifecycle in Hibernate typically consists of the following states:

Transient: When you create a new instance of an entity class using the new operator, it is in the transient state. Transient entities are not associated with any database table or session. They are not persisted or tracked by Hibernate. Transient entities become persistent when they are associated with a Hibernate session.

Persistent: A persistent entity is associated with a Hibernate session and mapped to a database table. Once an entity is associated with a session by calling methods like save or persist, it becomes persistent. Any changes made to the entity's properties are tracked by the session, and these changes are automatically synchronized with the database when the session is flushed or committed.

Detached: A detached entity is no longer associated with a Hibernate session but is still a persistent entity with a corresponding database record. Detached entities are usually the result of closing or clearing a session, or when an entity is explicitly detached using the evict or detach methods. While detached, entities are disconnected from the session and no longer managed by Hibernate. Changes made to detached entities need to be explicitly merged back into a session or reattached to a new session for persistence.

Removed: A removed entity is an entity that was previously persistent but has been marked for deletion. Calling the delete or remove method on a persistent entity transitions it into the removed state. The entity is still associated with the session until the session is flushed or committed. When the session is flushed or committed, the entity is deleted from the database.
